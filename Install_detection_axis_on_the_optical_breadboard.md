== Assembly of detection axis ==

=== Installing the detection axis holder base ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x detection axis holder base. 
*2x M6 x 25 mm capscrews

===== Tools needed =====

* 1x 5 mm hex key/driver

==== How and where to install the detection axis holder base ====

Place the detection axis holder base along the J column of M6 tapped holes, and line up the through holes with rows 2 & 4. Using the 5mm hex key/driver and the capscrews, screw the capscrews into the optical breadboard in both J2 & J4.

=== Installing the detection axis assembly ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Infinity spacer tube
*1x Olympus U-TLU tubelens
*1x Olympus C-mount (either the U-TV0.5XC-3 or U-TV1 X & U-CMAD3)

===== Tools needed =====

* 1x 1.5 mm hex key/driver
* 1x 3 mm hex key/driver

==== How and where to assemble the detection axis assembly ====

Take the infinity spacer tube with it's fully round open end and place it on the dovetail side on the Olympus U-TLU tubelens. Then using a 1.5 mm hex key/driver, screw the three opposing (120 degree apart) setscrews around the dovetail to fasten the two pieces together. Attach the Olympus C-mount to the tubelens and tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver.

== Camera installation ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Digital Camera (i.e. [http://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/community/life_science_camera/product/search/C11440-42U/index.html Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0LT])

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

==== How to attach the camera to the tube lens via the C-mount and secure on the OpenSPIM breadboard ====

Depending on the size of the camera chosen for the system, it may be necessary to take off the C-mount using the 3 mm hex key/driver. Either way, screw the camera on to the c-mount attaching it to the detection axis.

== Finishing up ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Detection Axis Top
*2x M5 x 50 mm capscrews

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 4 mm hex key/driver

==== How to clamp down the detection axis assembly with the top piece ====

Place the detection axis top over the detection axis assembly so that the M5 cap thru holes on the top piece are aligned with the M5 threaded holes on the base piece, then using the 4 mm hex key/driver, screw in the M5 x 50 mm capscrews.
