# Madison, WI, USA

{% include image src="LOCI-Setup.jpg" width="100%" caption="LOCI's L-SPIM, Jan. 22, 2016" %}

  [The Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI)](https://eliceirilab.org/) run by [Kevin Eliceiri](https://eliceirilab.org/profile/?smid=1175) at the University Wisconsin-Madison. It uses a Coherent Cube laser and a Hamamatsu Orca R^2 camera, being controlled by a 32-bit Windows XP computer.

  The OpenSPIM software was developed in this lab by Johannes Schindelin and Luke Stuyvenberg, and tested and refined with the help of Julie Last and Jayne Squirrel (see the [People](People ) page for details), using that setup. The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/openspim/micromanager).

# Heidelberg, Germany

{% include image src="COS_HD_OpenSPIM_1.JPG" width="100%" caption="COS Heidelberg OpenSPIM" %}

  [Maizel](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/a.maizel?l=_e) and [Lemke](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/s.lemke?l=_e) groups at the [Center for Organismal Studies](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/?l=_e) of Heidelberg University.

  This setup slightly differs from the specifications of OpenSPIM v1.0. In particular we use a [488 nm Cobolt laser](https://hubner-photonics.com/products/lasers/diode-lasers/06-01-series/), Nikon lenses and an [Orca-Flash4.0](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/cameras/cmos-cameras/index.html), the whole running under Windows7 Pro.

# Cambridge, UK, Maths Department

{% include image src="4arm_system.jpg" width="100%" caption="Fig. 1 Four-arm OpenSPIM" %}

  The [Goldstein](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/?l=_e) group in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/?l=_e) at the University of Cambridge.

  We recently extended to a 4-armed system (Fig. 1):

  - [4 port sample chamber](documents/4_port_chamber.pdf)

  - dual sided illumination with Vortran VersaLase multiple wavelength laser module (488, 561, 647 nm).

  - dual sided detection with 2 Photometrics [Coolsnap Myo](https://www.photometrics.com/support/legacy#pmccd).

  - We included a [Thorlabs shutter](https://www.thorlabs.de/search/thorsearch.cfm?search=shutters) in the beam path.

  - For brightfield illumination during sample positioning we use a [lamp](documents/LED_tube_light.pdf) that is temporarily inserted in one of the filter holders (Fig. 2)

  As part of the Biomaker Challenge 2018 we added the following modifications:

  - Adjustable metal feet were attached to the clamps that carry the detection arms to align the two cameras (Fig. 3)

  - We wanted to provide illumination for light dependent (photosynthetic) organisms between acquisitions of a time lapse recording.

  For this we added a lamp that switches on when the laser shutter closes.
  The LED driver is triggered by the laser shutter controller via a TTL inverter (Fig. 4).

  - To improve the robustness of the sample positioning we designed 3D printable sample holders (Fig. 5).

# Cambridge, UK, MRC LMB

  The Light Microscopy Facility at the [Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)

  - Our system features two-sided excitation with adjustable focus of the sheet lenses (Olympus 5x/0.15 air MPLFLN5X) which sit outside the imaging chamber to cope with different refractive indices. - 4 laser lines - combined in a separate laser bed and fed into a fibre (405nm & 640nm: both Coherent Cube; 488nm & 561nm: both Coherent Sapphire)

  - The imaging chamber can be heated to e.g. 37C for live cell imaging purposes. - Imaging lens is a Nikon 16x/0.8NA (N16XLWD-PF) with 3mm WD.

  - In front of the camera is a Thorlabs 6-position filter wheel (FW102C)

  - The entire system is portable (sort of) and modified to be laser safe as it is operated within our multi-user facility.

# Melbourne, Australia

{% include image src="Petrou_SPIM.jpg" width="100%" caption="OpenSPIM system using the Picard high-resolution stage and an Andor Neo camera in the Petrou Lab, Melbourne, Australia." %}

  The Petrou group at the [Florey Institute](https://florey.edu.au/science-research/research-teams/ion-channels-and-human-diseases-laboratory), the [Centre for Neural Engineering](https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/medicine-and-radiology-research/st-vincents-hospital/neural-engineering) and the [Centre for Integrated Brain Function](https://www.cibf.edu.au/?i=_e) at the University of Melbourne.

  - We are deploying OpenSPIM for CLARITY and Scaleview based imaging of brain tissue for studying neural morphology. We use Dragon Lasers and an Andor Neo sCMOS camera.

# Berlin, Germany

{% include image src="OpenSPIM_Berlin_top_view.png" width="100%" caption="OpenSPIM at Humboldt University Berlin" %}

  The Scholtz group at the [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.biologie.hu-berlin.de/de/gruppen/compzool_portal/)

  - I am interested in morphogenetic processes during early development of arthropods like the water flea Daphnia magna, the woodlouse Porcellio scaber or the beachhopper Parhyale hawaiensis. Using the SPIM technique for live imaging experiments enables us to observe dynamic and complex processes like gastrulation and beginning morphogenesis.

  - We implemented a Coherent Obis 561 nm laser and a Hamamatsu OrcaFlash4 sCMOS camera into the OpenSPIM system. The system runs at the moment with just one-side illumination. However, the sample chamber is already made for dual-side illumination (2x 10x illumination and 16x detection). Additionally we integrated a Nikon-module that allows us to increases our range of magnification (1x, 1,25x, 1,5x, 2x).

  The [College of Life and Environmental Sciences](https://lifesciences.exeter.ac.uk/) in association with the [College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/).

  - We have constructed the system with a Melles Griot 488nm Argon laser and a Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera running on 64-bit Windows 7 to image transgenic zebrafish.

  - The system currently has magnification options of 0.5x and 1x and 1-photon illumination with plans to upgrade to 2-photon in the future.

# Oulu, Finland

{% include image src="OpenSPIM_Oulu_top_view.jpg" width="100%" caption="OpenSPIM at the University of Oulu." %}

  The [Light Microscopy Core Facility, at the Biocenter Oulu and the University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/biocenter/lm).

  - Modified T-SPIM: dual side illumination with Vortran Stradus 488nm and 561nm lasers, ScopeLed G180 for bright field/transmitted light imaging, Olympus UMPLFLN 20X/0.5 W and Olympus LUMPLFLN 40X/0.8 W detection objectives, Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 camera. - Temperature, CO2 and O2 controlled liquid exchange/perfusion system for live cell imaging.

  - OpenSPIM has been used for live cell imaging: different cell types and spheroids in different 3D culture matrices, e.g. in Matrigel, collagen, myogel and fibrin mounted inside FEP tubes, and also for imaging living mouse skin cancer biopsies. It has also been used for whole mount stained and/or transgenic (expressing tdTomato, GFP, mCherry…) fixed samples, typically mouse embryonic kidneys, pieces of adult mouse tissues like heart, liver, fat, lung etc.

# Indianapolis, IN, USA

{% include image src="OpenSPIM_IUSM_LCDs.jpg" width="100%" caption="OpenSPIM at IUSM." %}

{% include image src="OpenSPIM_IUSM_Chamber_illuminated.jpg" width="100%" caption="OpenSPIM chamber with oblique illumination." %}

  The [Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy at Indiana University School of Medicine](https://web.medicine.iupui.edu/icbm/).

  - We extended the base L-SPIM design for use in a core facility by including additional excitation wavelengths and support for live imaging. We are imaging with an ORCA Flash 4.0 v2 using CameraLink.

  - To support more fluorophores we incorporated five laser lines (442, 488, 514, 568 and 647 nm) with AOTF modulation controlled via an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) based [6 channel DAC](https://www.ti.com/product/tlv5618a). Emission wavelength filtering is with a workhorse [Sutter Lambda 10-2](https://www.sutter.com/IMAGING/lambda102.html). Multichannel acquisition is fully controlled (AOTF, filter wheels, etc) by a custom version of the SPIM Acquisition Plugin and derivations of the Arduino device adapter for MicroManager. To assess laser power, a motorized mirror and ThorLabs detector have been incorporated prior to beam shaping.

  - To support live imaging we have incorporated a perfusion and temperature control system into the standard L-SPIM chamber(no drilling etc.) built with off-the-shelf components (shout-out to [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) and [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com)). It is Arduino based and relies on a bunch of pumps and thermistors. MicroManager integration and a CO2 loop is in the works (anyone with experience implementing [amphenol CO2 sensors](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Amphenol-Advanced-Sensors/T6615-50K/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvhkhGuTKDegrl2ezYd2qTk)?).

  - Our OpenSPIM is fully contained to simplify laser safety. To facilitate alignment and sample positioning a secondary camera driven by a [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) provides a live image of the chamber with oblique RGB LED illumination from an Arduino and PWM via the 16 channel [TLC5940](https://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/TLC5940).

  - To aid in sample positioning a knob bar is under development with four free-turning knobs-one for each axis with position feed-back. - IU OpenSPIM has been used for imaging of Zebrafish (live heart-beat and fixed and cleared tissue), organoids, and tissue samples including rat kidneys-most in FEP tubing. It has also been a testbed for new technologies and methodologies.

# Whole-brain imaging based on OpenSPIM, Warsaw, Poland

{% include image src="WarsawSPIM_doubleIllum.jpg" width="100%" caption="Cleared-tissue imaging SPIM at the Nencki Institute." %}

  We are the [Laboratory of Neurobiology at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland](http://www.nencki.gov.pl/pracownia-neurobiologii)

  - Using OpenSPIM as the starting point, we developed a cleared-tissue imaging SPIM system using dry 4X/0.13 Nikon objectives with WD of 17 mm, or about 25 mm in immersion

  - We use 3D printed chambers for CLARITY- and CUBIC-cleared tissue and glass cuvettes for BABB-cleared tissue

  - Recently we replaced the Picard stage with one by Standa, with greatly increased speed and travel range at comparable cost

  - Also recently a second illumination arm was added, converting the setup from the L to the T configuration

  - Ar-Ion laser (458/488/515 nm with manual filter wheel for wavelength selection) used for illumination

  - Beam height is raised to 65 mm, mainly for compatibility with the argon laser

  - We have demonstrated whole mouse and rat brain imaging ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28209/))

# OsloSPIM at the University of Oslo, Norway
We use our OpenSPIM to study how early mammalian embryo models (using so-called mouse gastruloids) grow and develop, and how the first organs form. Especially, we are interested in how cells self-organize and orchestrate their motion to form tissue. To explain the underpinning dynamics, we couple our experiments with 3D simulations. To fully utilize light-sheet imaging, we also study collective cell migration and how nerve cells make new connections in live zebrafish, and we study the cells' own recycling system (autophagy) in Drosophila larvae. 

https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/people/postdoctoral-fellows/endrejm/index/

- The illumination laser (Cobolt 6 series, Hübner Photonics) has laser heads with four different wavelengths (λ = 375, 488 561, 647 nm), corresponding to UV, green, red and far red light.
  
- Fast imaging: An Arduino UNO board sends trigger pulses to the laser to obtain fast switching between the different wavelengths (ideal for live imaging).
  
- Micro Manager controls the laser, camera (Andor Zyla 5.5, Andor), moveable 4D stage (USB-4D-Stage, Picard Industries), and the Arduino UNO board.
  
- Temperature control: To control the temperature, water at physiological temperature flows through channels in the viewing chamber, which is made of heat conducting aluminum.
  
- Media exchange: To provide fresh oxygen and nutrients to the 3D cell cultures, the media can be exchanged continually.
