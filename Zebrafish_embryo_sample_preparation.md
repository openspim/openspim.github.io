Zebrafish embryos should be mounted according to the imaging needs, e.g.:

1.  for short-term imaging: in 1.5% agarose inside a glass capillary,
    pushed out for imaging (the classic approach), w/ optional FEP tube
    support
2.  for long-term imaging: in 0.1% agarose inside a polymer (FEP) tube
3.  for long-term cardiac imaging: in 3% methylcellulose inside a polymer (FEP) tube

### Clean & cut FEP tubes

1.  flush tubes with 1 M NaOH, use syringe with attached needle
2.  transfer flushed tubes to fresh Falcon with 0.5 M NaOH, use forceps
3.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
4.  from now on, touch the tubes only with gloves and/or forceps!
5.  transfer the tubes from the Falcon into small basin with ddH2O and flush them with ddH2O
6.  flush the tubes with 70% EtOH
7.  transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with 70% EtOH
8.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
9.  cut the tube to small pieces of appropriate length
10. transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with ddH2O for storage

### Coat tubes w/ methyl cellulose

  - slowly take up 3% methyl cellulose with a needle-attached FEP tube
  - slowly push out the methyl cellulose and discard it
  - immediately proceed with mounting

### Prepare Zebrafish embryos

{% include image src="Dechorionation_micro02.JPG" width="40%" caption="Dechorionation II" %}

## Short-term imaging I: the classic approach

The method of choice mounting Zebrafish embryos is very similar to the one for [mounting Drosophila embryos](Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#Mounting_of_the_embryos).
It is simple and straight-forward, but restricts the embryo from growing. This limits the usable time frame for imaging to about 1-2 hours from the mounting.

<img src="images/Embedding_glass-capillary.png" width="40%">

If required for multi-view registration, add fluorescent beads to the melted aliquots of agarose. Keep the agarose aliquots at 38 deg Celsius. Transfer a Zebrafish embryo of choice to the agarose and take it up with a glass capillary (inner diameter around 1 mm) and a plunger. Let the agarose solidify and keep the embryo in the capillary submerged in fish medium. For imaging, push out the part of the agarose which contains the embryo. If required, add Tricaine to the imaging chamber.

## Short-term imaging II: FEP tube as additional support

<img src="images/Embedding_glass-capillary.png" width="30%">

  - take up an embryo w/ a FEP tube which is attached to a needle and syringe
  - wait a couple of minutes for the agarose to solidify and cut off the tube from the needle
  - store the prepared sample in a 1.5 ml reaction tube filled with E3 fish medium
  - quickly proceed w/ imaging

## Long-term imaging

The limitations of mounting a zebrafish embryo in 1.5% agarose can be overcome by using a lower concentration of agarose plus a transparent solid support. To achieve unpersuaded image quality, the refractive index of the support has to match that of the medium.
A good choice is FEP ([fluorinated ethylene propylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_ethylene_propylene)).
This polymer has a refractive index close to the one of water, and can be ordered as tube in various diameters right from the shelf. For imaging, the Zebrafish embryo is kept inside the cleaned and coated tube, embedded in 0.1% agarose with some Tricaine.
