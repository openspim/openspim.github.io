µOpenSPIM is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for OpenSPIM users, which relies on [µManager](https://micro-manager.org). You can also visit our [Github website](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM).

## Requirements
-   All hardware components of an OpenSPIM system (Laser, Camera, Stage, etc.) have to be pre-configured with µManager's Hardware Configuration Wizard using Version 2.0 gamma (nightly build 03 May 2021) on a Windows7/10 computer.
-   µOpenSPIM has been tested with Picard's USB 4D-Stage in mind. Using different 4D-Stages should work but could lead to unexpected behaviour.

## How to set up µManager?
-   [Click here](/micro-openspim_micromanager-configuration) if you have never created a working .cfg file with µManager before or/and want to get guidance on configuring multiple cameras, pixel size calibration and configuring an ArduinoUNO board for µManager.

## Installation and start-up
µOpenSPIM is in its beta stage and works with µManager 2.0.0 20210503 for Windows (nightly build 3rd May 2021).</br>
1.  Download and install the [64-bit build of µManager ](https://download.micro-manager.org/nightly/2.0.0-gamma/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_2.0.0-gamma1_20210503.exe) and follow its *Hardware Configuration Wizard* to create a functional configuration file (.cfg) that allows µManager to control the OpenSPIM hardware. On the first time startup of µOpenSPIM users will be asked to select the file location of µManager.

2.	**Download the latest version of µOpenSPIM 1.0.11 (28. November 2024)**
	-	[Win64bit](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM/releases/download/v1.0.11/OpenSPIM_setup_1.0.11.exe)
	-	[MACOSX](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM/releases/download/v1.0.11/OpenSPIM-1.0.11.dmg)

    **For EMBO Course µOpenSPIM 1.0.12beta (8. August 2025)**
    -   [Win64bit](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM/releases/download/v1.0.11/OpenSPIM_setup_1.0.12beta.exe)

3.  In the starting window multiple µManager configuration files can be added, removed and selected. Click *Add .cfg file* to add and then select your working µManager configuration file ending with .cfg. Then click the *Start* button. After loading the hardware µManager should now be ready for use.
