<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> has a depth of 300 mm and a width of 450
mm, with a grid of 12 x 18 M6 threaded holes spaced 25 mm apart from one
another. We will use a coordinate system similar to a spreadsheet (like
OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel) to make it easier to know where each
component and capscrew is positioned. Starting with A1 in the upper left

in between.

## Install 1" mirror assembly and its spacer post

##### Objects needed

  - 1x
    [POLARIS-K1](http://thorlabs.com/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=POLARIS-K1)
    1" mirror mount with mirror installed
  - 1x 25 mm tall optical post/spacer with M4 thru tap through the
    center
  - 1x ThorLabs part \#:
    [SD1](http://thorlabs.com/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SD1) - M4 to M6
    adapter
  - 1x M4 x 45 mm capscrew
  - 1x M4 nut

##### Tools needed

  - 1x 3 mm hex key/driver
  - 1x Needle nosed pliers

##### How to install the large mirror mount on the corner of the optical breadboard

Put the M4 x 45 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the
capscrew/adapter assembly through the **bottom** side of the optical
breadboard in a corner M6 thru tap. It is easy to differentiate between
the thru tap and threaded hole, because the thru tap is off the usual
grid between 4 threaded holes. The bottom side is the side where you can
see 2 different diameters of thru tap, the larger one that stops half
way through the optical breadboard is where the SD1 washer can rest.

**<span style="color:#FF0000"> From here on out till the completion of
the installation of the OpenSPIM the furthest threaded hole juxtaposed
in the opposite corner to the 1" mirror post will be called A1.</span>**

## Install the CUBE laser heatsink

##### Objects needed

  - 1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode
  - 1x Machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink
  - 4x M6 x 25 mm capscrews

##### Tools needed

  - 1x 5 mm hex key/driver

##### How and where to install the laser with heatsink on the optical breadboard

Place the laser heatsink so that the mounting capscrew holes/notches are
at D8, D10, H8 & H10 on the optical breadboard respectively. Using a 5
mm hex key/driver, screw the heatsink down to the optical breadboard
using M6x25 mm capscrews.

*Note that in this video the laser is already bolted onto the heatsink.*

## Mount the laser on the laser heat sink

##### Objects needed

  - 1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode
  - 1x Machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink (that will raise
    the laser beam output to 50 mm off the surface of the optical
    breadboard)
  - 4x M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser with their included
    washers.
  - 1x Heat transfer paste

##### Tools needed

  - 1x 3 mm hex key/driver

##### Directions

<b>Wear latex or nitril gloves</b> that comfortably fit your hands\!
Apply heat transfer paste to the surface of the metal heat sink block
where the CUBE laser will sit (everywhere between the four M4 threaded
holes). Put the M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser through their
included washers and the top of the holes in the base plate of the CUBE
laser into the heatsink. using a 3 mm hex key/driver, screw the CUBE
laser down onto the surface of the heatsink where the heat transfer
paste is applied. Remove excess heat transfer paste with gloves on your
hands\!

## Mount dovetail rails onto optical breadboard

##### Objects needed

  - 1x ThorLabs part \#:
    [RLA075/M](http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RLA075/M)
    75 mm dovetail rail
  - 2x ThorLabs part \#:
    [RLA150/M](http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RLA150/M)
    150 mm dovetail rails
  - 1x ThorLabs part \#:
    [RLA300/M](http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RLA300/M)
    300 mm dovetail rail
  - 6x (or more) M6 x 16 mm capscrews

##### Tools needed

  - 1x 5 mm hex key/driver

##### How to and where to install the dovetail rails on the optical breadboard

Place one of the 150 mm dovetail rails lengthwise with its ends on B6 to
B12. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along
the length of the dovetail rail in holes B7 through B11. I personally
put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

Place the 300 mm dovetail rail lengthwise along row 11 between columns D
and O. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews in the
middle of the 2 long slit holes of the dovetail rail in holes F11 and
M11. You can slide the position of the dovetail rail 25 mm along its
long axis.

Place the other 150 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on Q5 to
Q11. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along
the length of the dovetail rail in holes Q6 through Q10. I personally
put 2 M6 capscrews in Q7 and Q9.

Place the 75 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on O3 to R3.
Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews along the length
of the dovetail rail in holes P3 through Q3. I personally put 2 M6
capscrews in B8 and B10.

## Install both Ø1" mirror assemblies on rail system

##### Objects needed

  - 2x Ø1" mirror assemblies on rail carriers
  - 1x Optical breadboard with dovetail rail system installed

##### Tools needed

  - None

##### How and where to install the Ø1" mirror mounts on the first 150 mm dovetail rail

Position the two Ø1" mirror assemblies on their respective rail carriers
on the first 150 mm dovetail rail so that the laser beam will be
reflected along the whole rail system. The first Ø1" mirror assembly
should face 45 degrees to the right of the front of the laser while the
second should face 45 degrees to the left. See the images or video below
for further clarification.

**Make sure that the position of the horizontal adjustment screw is on
the left side when looking from behind. Also, the rail carriers
tightening knobs should always face out along the edge of the OpenSPIM
system.**

## Install the OpenSPIM chamber

##### Objects needed

  - 1x OpenSPIM chamber assembly
  - 1x Optical breadboard with dovetail rail system installed

##### Tools needed

  - None

##### How and where to install the OpenSPIM chamber on the rail system

Slide the OpenSPIM chamber assembly onto the 75 mm dovetail rail along
the 20x detection objective axis so that the back of the 10x
illumination objective is facing the Ø1" mirror mount on the stand in
the corner along the second 150 mm dovetail rail axis.
