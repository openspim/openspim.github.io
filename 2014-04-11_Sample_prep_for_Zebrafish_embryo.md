Michael Weber from Jan Huisken lab has put together a nice protocol page
describing [preparation of zebrafish embryos for multi-view SPIM
imaging](Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation "wikilink"). Lots of
photographs\!

For more information see the JoVE video of the protocol

  - [Multilayer Mounting for Long-term Light Sheet Microscopy of
    Zebrafish](http://www.jove.com/video/51119/multilayer-mounting-for-long-term-light-sheet-microscopy-of-zebrafish)

and the paper in Development

  - [Multilayer mounting enables long-term imaging of zebrafish
    development in a light sheet
    microscope](http://dev.biologists.org/content/139/17/3242.abstract)
