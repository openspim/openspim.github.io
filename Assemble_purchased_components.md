<!-- end list -->

  - 1x 1.3 mm hex key/driver

##### How to assemble the cylindrical lens system

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after taking the
Ø1" external threaded ring out, put the lens inside the mount with its
arrow on the banding pointing in the direction of the light path. Use
the SM1 Spanner Wrench to put the ring back into the threading and
tighten until the lens does not move.

Align the rotation using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver by loosening the two
screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face
plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to
the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face
screws down one the desired position is reached.

## Assembly of OpenSPIM Chamber

##### Objects needed

  - 1x Olympus

    water dipping objective

    20x/0.5 water dipping objective
  - 2x Machined [objective holder
    rings](:File:OpenSPIM_SPIM-Chamber_Objective-Ring.PDF "wikilink")
  - 6x M3 x 8 mm capscrews
  - 2x NBR 70 20x3mm O-rings
  - 1x Machined or 3D printed [sample
    chamber](:File:OpenSPIM_SPIM-Chamber.PDF "wikilink")/[chamber
    holder](:File:OpenSPIM_SPIM-Chamber_Holder.PDF "wikilink")
  - 2x M6 x 8 mm capscrews
  - 1x Machined or 3D printed sample chamber

##### Tools needed

  - 1x 2.5 or 3 mm hex key/driver
  - 1x 5 mm hex key/driver

##### How to assemble the OpenSPIM chamber

Put both O-rings into their places in the sample chamber where the
objectives will go. Attach the acrylic sample chamber to the metallic
chamber base using the two large M6 capscrews so that the round wholes
in each piece face each other. Next screw the illumination and detection
objective into the machined objective holder rings. Now orient the
chamber so that the acrylic face of the chamber without the opening is
facing you and the openings are to your left and away from you. Push the
10x/0.3 illumination objective though the metal and the O-ring-equipped
acrylic holes. It may require considerable force, it is recommended to
moisten the O-rings beforehand. Rotate the objective so that the three
objective holder base threaded holes are aligned with the holes in the
metallic chamber base and the flat part of the objective ring is flush
with the top of the chamber base. Use three M3 x 8 mm screws to attach
the objective to the chamber base as tightly as possible. Repeat the
same procedure for the 20x/0.5 detection objective.

## Assembly of the motor system

##### Objects needed

  - 1x USB-4D-Stage from Picard-Industries
      - 1x supplied 4D system sample arm
      - 5x M3 x 6 mm capscrews
  - 1x [NSK 6001Z](http://de.rs-online.com/web/p/kugellager/4090057/)
  - 1x sample pully
  - 1x motor pully

##### Tools needed

##### How to assemble the OpenSPIM 4D positioning system

Install the ball bearing system into the end of the sample arm where the
hole is drilled, make the hole just a few 10's of microns smaller than
the outside diameter of the ball bearing system and that it is flush
with the bottom face of the sample arm.

Then attach the arm to the system by aligning the holes on the arm that
will fit the capscrew heads into them with the M3 threaded holes in the
plate attached to the Y motor.

Attach the motor pulley to the motor by tightening it down with a M2.5
set screw to the motor shaft, and drop the sample pulley into the 12 mm
ball bearing hole on the sample arm. Finally use a rubber band or large
diameter small gauge o-ring to go around both pulleys.
